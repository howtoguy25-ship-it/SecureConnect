This app doesn't guess at "police car" or similar — real-world testing showed that kind of fine-grained guess being confidently wrong too often to trust, so it isn't claimed at all. A separate light-flash detector flags any vehicle with an actively strobing red/blue light as "Unmarked police?" (violet box) regardless of vehicle type — it only catches lights that are actually on, not antennas or other hardware, and is real-time evidence rather than a guess. Speed (a rough estimate, not radar-accurate) and the plate estimate only show for a vehicle seen face-on (front or rear) — side-on, the box just shows type and confidence, since neither the speed model nor a plate is reliable from that angle. A small cyan box only appears once a real on-device text read of a plate actually succeeds (shown beside the box) — never just a location guess with nothing behind it. It keeps retrying a legible-looking plate for a little while rather than giving up after one bad frame, then stops once it succeeds or after enough genuine tries — never stored or sent anywhere. It's a genuine but general-purpose OCR engine, not one built for plates specifically, so treat any reading as a rough attempt, not a confirmed plate number. Each vehicle tracked steadily for under a second (and seen face-on) gets green corner brackets (🔒) showing it's locked on, independently of every other vehicle in frame, and the nearest one is marked 🎯 Closest.`}
